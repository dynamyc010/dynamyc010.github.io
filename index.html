<h2>So, you already know my nickname. IRL name I'd rather not share here, but it really isn't hard to find if you know me.</h2>
<h4>Some notable things I might be known for:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>I'm a proud helper on the Team Halfbeard Discord server! <a href="https://discord.com/invite/SdWBfVS" target="_blank">(Join now!)</a></li>
    <li>One of my biggest projects here on GitHub was G4X's Discord Integration that you can find <a href="https://github.com/Team-G4/g4x" target="_blank"></a>!<br>
    <h6>(Sadly that project died down, so you won't see anything happening in there.)</h6></li>
    <li>I sometimes make A Hat in Time mods. Tho I'm not known for that. <h6>(I lost all my in-works mods when I reinstalled the game and I haven't been motivated to re-do them.)</h6></li>
    <li>what is life</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!-- Accounts Page -->
<div class="container" id="accounts">
<br> <!-- Once again, these are used to make the text get into a good position. God dammit margins. -->
<br> 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>These are my accounts. If you wanna talk, I suggest Discord, since I use that the most, but Steam might also work.</h1>
<h6>(Though on Steam, <a id="bold">please</a> tell me why you add me. I don't like a cluttered Friends list.)</h6>
