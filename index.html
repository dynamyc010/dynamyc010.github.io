<h2>So, you already know my nickname. And since you got here,</h2>
<h4>some notable things I <i>might</i> be known for:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>I'm a proud helper on the Team Halfbeard Discord server! <a href="https://discord.com/invite/SdWBfVS" target="_blank">(Join now!)</a></li>
    <li>One of my biggest projects here on GitHub was G4X's Discord Integration that you can find <a href="https://github.com/Team-G4/g4x" target="_blank"></a>!<br>
    <h6>(Sadly that project died down, so you won't see anything happening in there.)</h6></li>
    <li>I sometimes make A Hat in Time mods. Tho I'm not known for that. <h6>(I lost all my in-works mods when I reinstalled the game and I haven't been motivated to re-do them.)</h6></li>
    <li>what is life</li>
</ul>
<h5>I used to screw around a lot with JS, but ever since 2020, I've lost interest in almost everything. Go figure.</h5>
<h5>I don't know why, I don't know what to do. This website was fun to make, but I'm usually not this... you know, up for coding.</h5>
<h5>I currently live in hungary, and while I don't like it that much, I don't hate it either.</h5>
<h5>Please, if you feel like I could be a <i>(possibly)</i> good friend, add me on Discord. You can find it <a href="#accounts">here</a>.</h5>
